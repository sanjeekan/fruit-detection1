Fruit Detection and Classification using SIFT and SVM

This repository contains the implementation of a fruit detection and classification model. The model uses SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform) for feature extraction and SVM (Support Vector Machine) for classification. It is trained to classify fruits into five categories: apple, banana, grape, mango, and strawberry.
